## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- **Context API**: Chosen for its simplicity and built-in React support
- **Separation of Concerns**: Auth and Data contexts kept separate
- **localStorage Integration**: Automatic persistence of all data changes

### Routing
- **React Router v6**: Modern declarative routing with nested routes
- **Protected Routes**: Role-based access control with automatic redirects
- **Layout Routes**: Shared layouts for admin and patient sections

### Authentication
- **Simulated Authentication**: No external auth service required
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate layouts and routes for admin/patient
- **Session Persistence**: User sessions maintained across browser refreshes

### Data Storage
- **localStorage**: All data persisted locally as per requirements
- **JSON Structure**: Normalized data structure for patients and incidents
- **File Storage**: Base64 encoding for file attachments

### Component Architecture
- **Functional Components**: Modern React patterns with hooks
- **Reusable Components**: Modular design for maintainability
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### File Upload System

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Known Limitations
- File storage limited by localStorage capacity (~5-10MB)
- No real-time collaboration features
- Client-side only data validation
- No server-side persistence

### Future Enhancements

## 📝 Technical Decisions

1. **React + Vite**: Fast development and build times
2. **React Router v6**: Modern routing with better performance
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid development
4. **shadcn/ui**: High-quality, accessible component library
5. **Context API**: Lightweight state management solution
6. **React Hook Form**: Performant forms with minimal re-renders
7. **Zod**: Type-safe schema validation
8. **date-fns**: Lightweight date manipulation library
9. **localStorage**: Simple persistence without external dependencies

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Large file uploads may cause performance issues
- Browser localStorage limits may be reached with extensive use
